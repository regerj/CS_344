Compile the program using the command:

gcc --std=gnu99 -o movies main.c Header.h linkedList.h mem.c userInterface.h linkedList.c mem.h userInterface.c

Run the program using ./movies {your_file_here.csv}

There are no memory leaks.

Because it was not required by the assignment and I was busy this week, I didn't write commented documentation in the program files.

Thanks!
